### Medical Image Classification using Deep Learning

In the past few decades, developments in medical imaging technology and the increased role of imaging within the diagnostic process have resulted in a rapid expansion of recorded medical visual data, generating a need for novel computational models.

Deep learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that involves creating neural networks that can learn and make predictions based on complex and large data sets. In radiology, deep learning allows for more accurate and precise diagnosis of cancer, as it can analyze large amounts of medical imaging data and detect subtle abnormalities that may be missed by the human eye.

For such a project, you need to learn the machine learning or deep learning algorithms, such as convolutional neural networks, for the classification task. And you should use the frameworks like `pytorch`/`tensorflow` to aid your development.

And finally, you need to describe your model for predicting/classification through visualization.
